# Physics-Informed RL HVAC System for Smart Buildings

## üìå Overview
This project explores **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for adaptive HVAC control in smart buildings.  
It combines the **CU-BEMS dataset** with **NASA POWER weather data**, predictive modeling with **LightGBM**, and a **Streamlit app** for TOU pricing simulation.

The focus is on **AC1 & AC4** units, which showed the strongest temperature sensitivity.  
An interactive dashboard enables scenario testing (Baseline, Eco, Aggressive) and generates automated PDF reports.
